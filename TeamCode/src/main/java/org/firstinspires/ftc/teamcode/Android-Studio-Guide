How to set up Android Studio

1 - install the latest version of android studio:
https://developer.android.com/studio

2 - clone the project using github:
https://github.com/a-f-waterhouse/Robotics2024

3 - click build, and if you have no errors: congratulations, you're good to skip to step 13

4 - otherwise, if there's anything about gradle/javascript being outdated/incompatible the keep going!

5 - install Java 13.0 (i can send you the installer .exe to save you having to make an oracle account)

6 - install gradle 7.4.2:
https://gradle.org/releases/

 7 - unzip the gradle file and remember where you put it!

8 - open the project in android studio, and navigate to File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle 

9 - change the distribution to "Local Installation", and choose the file where you put your version of Gradle

10 - for Grade JDK, select "13 Oracle OpenJDK 13.0.1" or whichever one seems to be your local installation of Java 13

11 - Build again, and that *should* have fixed the errors! 

12 - connect up to the control hub (either by wifi or cable) and make sure it is selected at the top under devices

13 - click run!
